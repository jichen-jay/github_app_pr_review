# GitHub Pull Request Code Review Bot

This project builds on [Agent to review code in Github PRs](https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-review). It has been adapted to work with the **GitHub** platform, adding the following features:

1. **Webhook Integration**: The GitHub platform sends webhook data when a new Pull Request is created in a watched repository.
2. **Automated Review**: The review generated by the LLM (Large Language Model) is posted directly as a comment on the Pull Request.

## How It Works

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Deploy the Project on Flows.network

- Deploy the project on [Flows.network](https://flows.network).
- After deployment, you will receive a **Webhook URL**.

Please note that the code to run is located in the `github_pr_review` folder, put it in the `Directory` field in the table

### 3. Configure Webhook in Your Repository

- In your repository settings on GitHub, set up a webhook to trigger on **Pull Request events**.
- Use the **Webhook URL** you obtained from Flows.network.

### 4. Automated Review Posting

- Once the Flows function reviews the Pull Request, the bot will automatically post the review as a comment on the Pull Request, similar to the example below:

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that the webhook is correctly configured to listen for **Pull Request events**.
- The bot will only post reviews for new Pull Requests after the webhook is set up.

By following these steps, you can automate the code review process for your GitHub repositories using the power of Flows.network and LLM-based reviews.
